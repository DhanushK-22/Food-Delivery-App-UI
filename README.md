![Project Banner](link-to-banner-image) 
## üìã Project Overview

This project is a conceptual design for a **Food Delivery Application** created using Figma. The goal was to design an intuitive and engaging user interface (UI) that provides a seamless user experience (UX) for browsing and ordering food.

The project includes interactive UI elements, animations, and transitions to simulate the flow of a real application.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Homepage Design**: An engaging homepage with featured restaurants, search functionality, and promotional banners.
- **Restaurant Listings**: A clean and responsive design showcasing restaurants and their ratings.
- **Food Menu**: Detailed view of menu items, complete with images, prices, and description.
- **Cart and Checkout**: A streamlined cart and checkout experience, ensuring smooth transitions from selection to order.
- **Order Tracking**: Order confirmation and tracking screens to show order status.

## üé® Animations

The following animations were used in this project to enhance the user experience:

- **Button Click Animations**: Subtle hover and click animations on buttons for a tactile feel.
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth transitions between different screens to mimic app-like behavior.
- **Loading Animations**: Custom loading animations for data fetching scenarios.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key screens:

1. **Login and Sign Up**
2. **Home Page**
3. **Restaurant Listings**
4. **Menu and Food Details**
5. **Cart and Checkout**
6. **Order Tracking**
